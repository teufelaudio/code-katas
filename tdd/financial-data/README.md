# Financial data code refactoring kata

## What do we want to build?

This time....nothing!

A robot has created some terrible code and we want to refactor it into something more maintainable.

We should still use TDD for our refactoring. There are some test scenarios already provided by the same robot, but 
we should first check these and add and additional scenarios that might have been missed before starting to refactor the 
business code.

## What do we try to work out with this kata?

Please use strict TDD for this:

- DO NOT write any code until you have a failing test
- DO NOT refactor until you have a passing test
