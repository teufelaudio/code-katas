# Teufel Code Katas

This repo aims to collect the code result after our code-katas sessions in all software departments.

## What's a Code Kata?

As a group, software developers don't practice enough. Most of our learning takes place on the job, which means that
most of our mistakes get made there as well.

Other creative professions practice: artists carry sketchpads, musicians play technical pieces, and poets constantly
rewrite works. In karate, where the aim is to learn to spar or fight, most of a student's time is spent learning and
refining basic moves. These are katas.

Katas exist to help developers get the same benefits as practicing in any other profession. There are simple, artificial
exercises that let you experiment and learn without the pressure of a production environment.

No right or wrong answers exist in any software kata: the benefit comes from the process, not the result.
