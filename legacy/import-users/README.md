# üë©‚Äçüíª The Import Users Kata

> This is a refactoring kata üîß

The kata consists on reading, parsing & print data from different sources (csv & network).

---

A college from your company created a simple script that read users,
unfortunately that person left the company a few months ago, and you need to
change the functionality, but you find out the current code gets more and more
tangled over the time. You talked to your boss, and he decided to give you time
to improve it.

The current code is very basic but no-one feels comfortable or want to modify
it.

- Improve the current code, but maintaining the original behaviour
- Split logic into different functions/classes if necessary
- Consider testing ("black-box" & "white-box")
- Have fun!

### ‚è© Next iteration

Instead of displaying the output through terminal, store the information
somewhere else, like a text file or a SQLite database.
